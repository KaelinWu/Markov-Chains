This project investigates the use of Markov Chains to model and predict hourly trading volume for various tickers listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ. The motivation behind this work is that while returns are difficult and noisy to predict, trading volume tends to show more structured patterns throughout the day, making it a promising target for modeling. Volume is also a critical input for proprietary trading models, and by focusing on it, we aim to build a more stable and interpretable component for potential use in execution or alpha strategies.

We chose to model hourly volume rather than daily aggregates in order to capture time-of-day effects, allowing for a more detailed and expressive state space that reflects how volume behaves differently in the morning, midday, and late afternoon sessions. The core modeling framework is a discrete-time Markov Chain, where each hour's volume state depends probabilistically on the previous hour's state. States are defined based on discretized volume levels—such as low, medium, or high—and transitions between them are used to build transition matrices for forecasting.

The historical data used in this project was collected using the Alpaca Trading API, which provided minute-level OHLCV data. This data was aggregated into hourly bins, preprocessed, and then used to fit the Markov models. The development work was done in Python using common data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, with Jupyter Notebooks serving as the primary development environment. The codebase is modularized for extensibility, allowing future integration of hidden Markov models, higher-order transitions, or live data prediction features.

Potential use cases for this model include intraday liquidity forecasting, volume-aware execution strategies, and enhancing predictive models by conditioning on expected volume. Future improvements could involve real-time deployment, the modeling of additional tickers and exchanges, or incorporating anomalies and event-driven effects.

This repository contains the full code, notebooks, and supporting documentation for the project. The folder structure includes directories for source code, notebooks, and (optionally) data.
